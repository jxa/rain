# Rain

Drawing raindrops on html5 canvas with clojurescript and core.async. Based on http://maroslaw.github.io/rainyday.js/demo1.html

## Getting started

```lein ring server```

This should launch a web server on localhost:3000 and open a browser window.
If you want to modify the clojurescript source, open another terminal window and type
```lein cljsbuild auto```


## TODO

* raindrops aren't really circles
* add reflection and/or transparency to drops
* performance could be better
